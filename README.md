# 15-Five – Employee Check-In & Performance Management System

A **Django-based performance management system** inspired by the 15Five model, designed to enable **regular employee check-ins**, structured feedback, and continuous performance tracking between employees and admins.

This project replaces that approach with **weekly/monthly check-ins**, allowing organizations to:

* Track employee progress continuously

* Improve manager–employee communication
* Maintain structured performance data

* Review employee submissions
* Track overall check-in completion status
* Receive Slack & email notifications

### **Employee**

* Submit responses or save drafts
* View submission history
* Update profile and password

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Django
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* **Database:** SQLite
* **Notifications:** Slack API, Email (SMTP)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
